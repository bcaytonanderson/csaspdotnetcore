ASP.NET Core

Unit 1:
-------
This lesson will create a .NET MVC Application which manages a pen-and-paper style tabletop game.
	-Will allow users to add new characters
	-Will show all characters.

	-Setting up the index view:
		-Create the index view as a .cshtml file which allows us to write our HTML views and add in C# code. This uses a built-in engine called Razor.

		-To populate the list of characters dynamically, we start out by using the Razor keyword @model with a datatype String. 
			-lowercase @model defines the data coming into the view
			-uppercase @Model access the model data.

	-Set up controller to send data to the view.
		-The index method (public IActionResult Index() ) returns an IActionResult.
			-Methods which return this are called "action methods". Action methods PROVIDE RESPONSES USABLE BY BROWSERS.

	ROUTES
		-What happens if we omit the route in our URL? It will default a controller and action- normally it will default to www.url.com/Home/Index
